# Cryptaris System Manual

## Introduction
Cryptaris is a high-performance, secure web application designed for advanced data privacy. It combines military-grade encryption with a "Modern Clean/Luxury Minimalist" aesthetic to provide a premium user experience. This manual describes the features and usage of the Cryptaris system.

## Core Features

### 1. Encryption & Decryption
Cryptaris supports robust encryption for various data types. All encryption uses a dual-key system (User Key + System Key) to ensure maximum security.

*   **Text Encryption**: Securely encrypt plain text messages.
*   **File Encryption**: Encrypt documents, images, audio, and video files. The system supports a wide range of formats.
*   **God Mode Security**: Files are locked to your specific system instance using unique markers, preventing unauthorized decryption even if the user key is stolen.

**Usage:**
1.  Navigate to the **Encrypt** page.
2.  Select the type of data (Text, Document, Audio, Video, Image).
3.  Upload your file or enter text.
4.  Enter a strong password (User Key).
5.  Click **Encrypt**. The system will generate a secured file or text block.

To **Decrypt**, simply navigate to the **Decrypt** page, upload the encrypted file, and enter the original password.

### 2. Steganography (Hide & Reveal)
Steganography allows you to hide secret messages *inside* innocent-looking images.

*   **Hide**: Upload a cover image and enter your secret message. The system embeds the message into the image code without visibly altering the picture.
*   **Reveal**: Upload the image containing the secret message to extract the hidden text.

### 3. Secure Link Generation
Share sensitive information securely using time-bound links.

*   **Create Link**: Enter your secret message. You can set an expiration time (e.g., 1 hour, 1 day) and an optional password.
*   **Access Link**: The recipient clicks the link and (if required) enters the password to view the message. Once expired, the message is permanently destroyed.

### 4. Decoy Generator
Confuse potential attackers by generating fake, realistic-looking documents. This tool creates "honeyfiles" that look valuable but contain useless data.

*   **Financial Reports**: Generates fake CSV files with realistic transaction data.
*   **Corporate Directories**: Creates fake employee lists with names, roles, and departments.
*   **Personal Diaries**: Generates fake personal text entries.

**Usage:**
1.  Navigate to **Tools > Decoy Generator**.
2.  Select the type of decoy (Financial, Corporate, Personal).
3.  Download the generated file and place it among your real files to mislead snoops.

### 5. Password Analyzer
Check the strength of your passwords before using them.
*   The system analyzes entropy, dictionary words, and patterns.
*   Provides a score (0-4) and estimated crack time.

## Security Architecture (High Level)
*   **Dual-Layer Encryption**: Data is protected by both your password and a hidden system key.
*   **Client-Side Privacy**: Your passwords are never stored in plain text.
*   **Ephemeral Storage**: Sensitive data in "Secure Links" is stored transiently and deleted upon expiration.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I recover my file if I lose my password?**
A: No. Cryptaris does not store your passwords. If you lose your key, the data is irretrievably lost. This is a security feature, not a bug.

**Q: Can I decrypt a file on a different computer?**
A: By default, "God Mode" ties encryption to the specific system instance. You may need the System Master Key from the original machine to decrypt on a new device.

**Q: Is the Decoy Generator data real?**
A: No. All names, transactions, and entries are algorithmically generated using randomization.
